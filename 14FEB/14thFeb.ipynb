    "Multithreading in Python refers to the ability to run multiple threads or processes simultaneously within a single process. Each thread is a separate flow of execution, with its own logic. Multithreading is used to improve the performance of a program by making better use of the available CPU resources.\n",

    "Python has a built-in threading module that provides a higher-level interface for creating and managing threads. This module allows you to create and start new threads, manage their life cycle, and share data between them."
